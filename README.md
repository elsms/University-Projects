### Computer Programming and Data Management Project 
In this project, we analyzed the key factors influencing voter behavior during the 2020 US Presidential Election and examined their potential impact on the election results. The data used in this notebook were retrieved from the 2020 ANES Time Series survey, along with additional data stored in the Response.xlsx file.
To identify the most significant variables, we conducted two multivariate logistic regression analyses, each using a different response variable. First, we estimated voter party preferences, and then we separately analyzed voter presidential preferences. (Note: This notebook represents my individual contribution to the project).
